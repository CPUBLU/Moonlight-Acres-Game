# Moonlight-Acres-Game
This is a quick little game I made for my computer ethics class. 
Why should i get a good grade on this project? Frankly I think it is withing the B range on a grading scale. I put effort into the making of it; while a simple design, I put a lot of effort into making as I am not very good at coding. The story is about you in a cabin discovering that you have been spied on during your whole stay and what things you should do about it. Frankly there isn't much in reality that you can do since you signed the paper stating that they have the right to use your likeness and take video of you. Although you find that out if you reach the longest ending. I think the moral of the story is relavant to us today. We sign whatever terms of use contract we're given without any thought into what we actually sign. We can be spied on, information stolen and what-not without our knowledge even though we gave them permission. That is also why I included the legal battle at the end, you could try and fight them but you already gave permission with a legally binding document. Ultimately: you need to watch your every step in what permissions you give companies as you don't know what they're doing. Thats also the biggest takeaway ive had from this class.
